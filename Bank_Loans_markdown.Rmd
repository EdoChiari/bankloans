QUESTION 1: What is the average income of customers who have defaulted compared to those who have not?

```{r}
#Calculate the average income of customers by default status
average_income <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(default)) %>%
  group_by(default) %>%
  summarise(average_income = mean(income,na.rm = TRUE))

print(average_income)
```

To compare the incomes of customers who default and those who do not, we conducted both a Welch Two Sample t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test.

T-test for Statistical Significance
```{r}
# Perform a t-test to check if the difference in average income is statistically significant
t_test_resultq1 <- t.test(income ~ default, data = data)
print(t_test_resultq1)
```
Interpretation:
The t-test results indicate that the difference in mean incomes between defaulters and non-defaulters is not statistically significant (p-value = 0.09301). However, this test assumes that income data is normally distributed, which may not be the case.
The Mann-Whitney U test results show a statistically significant difference (p-value = 0.00005535), suggesting that when considering the ranks of the incomes, defaulters and non-defaulters do have significantly different income levels. This test does not assume normality and is more robust to skewed distributions and outliers.

Graphic representation (Boxplot):
```{r}
# Filter out rows where 'default' is NA
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(default))

ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = factor(default), y = income)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 125)) +
  labs(x = "Default Status", y = "Income", title = "Income Distribution by Default Status") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Non-Defaulter", "Defaulter")) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 125, by = 10)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

Conclusion:
Given that income data is typically not normally distributed and may be skewed, the Mann-Whitney U test provides a more reliable analysis. Therefore, the significant result from the Mann-Whitney U test should be highly considered. This indicates that there is a significant difference in incomes between defaulters and non-defaulters, with non-defaulters generally having higher incomes.



QUESTION 2: How does the debt-to-income ratio vary across different education levels

```{r}
# Calculate the average debt-to-income ratio by education level
debt_to_income <- data %>%
  group_by(ed) %>%
  summarise(average_debt_to_income_ratio = mean(debtinc,na.rm = TRUE))

print(debt_to_income)
```
To investigate how the debt-to-income ratio varies across different education levels, we will conduct the following analyses:

	1.	ANOVA Test for Statistical Significance
	2.	Post-Hoc Test to Identify Pairwise Differences

ANOVA for Statistical Significance
```{r}
# Ensure 'ed' is treated as a factor
data <- data %>%
  mutate(ed = as.factor(ed))

# Perform ANOVA to test if there are significant differences in debt-to-income ratio across education levels
anova_result <- aov(debtinc ~ ed, data = data)
summary(anova_result)
```
Interpretation: The ANOVA test shows that the education level (ed) does not significantly affect the debt-to-income ratio (debtinc) in the dataset. The F-value is 0.679, and the p-value is 0.607, which is much greater than the typical significance level of 0.05. This indicates that there is no statistically significant difference in the debt-to-income ratio across the different education levels.

Since the ANOVA test did not show significant differences, we proceed with a post-hoc test to further investigate if there are any specific pairwise differences between the education levels.

Post-Hoc Test to Identify Pairwise Differences
```{r}
# Perform Tukey's HSD post-hoc test
post_hoc_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)
print(post_hoc_result)
```
Interpretation: The Tukey HSD post-hoc test confirms the ANOVA results. None of the comparisons between different education levels show a statistically significant difference (all p-values are much greater than 0.05). This further supports that education level does not significantly influence the debt-to-income ratio.

Density Plot:
```{r}
# Density plot
ggplot(data, aes(x = debtinc, fill = ed)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of Debt-to-Income Ratio by Education Level",
    x = "Debt-to-Income Ratio",
    y = "Density"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_discrete(name = "Education Level")
```
Key Observation from the graph: There is no clear separation between the distributions of debt-to-income ratios for different education levels. This aligns with the statistical analysis which found no significant difference between the groups.
Additionally, most distributions appear to be right-skewed (longer tail on the right), indicating that while most individuals have lower debt-to-income ratios, there are a few with much higher ratios.

Conclusion: Education level does not have a significant impact on the debt-to-income ratio, as indicated by both the ANOVA and the Tukey HSD post-hoc test.


QUESTION 3: What is the distribution of customers by age group and their defaut rates

```{r}
# Create age groups
data <- data %>%
  mutate(age_group = case_when(
    age >= 18 & age <= 29 ~ '18-29',
    age >= 30 & age <= 39 ~ '30-39',
    age >= 40 & age <= 49 ~ '40-49',
    age >= 50 ~ '50+',
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))

#Calculate the total customers and default rates by age group
age_distribution <- data %>%
  group_by(age_group) %>%
  summarise(
    total_customers = n(),
    total_defaults = sum(default, na.rm = TRUE),
    default_rate = (sum(default, na.rm = TRUE) / n()) * 100 
  )

print(age_distribution)
```
Major considerations:
1) High Default rate in Younger Age Group (18-29):
The default rate for this category is the highest at 24.70%. This could indicate that younger individuals are at a higher risk of defaulting on their loans; this could be caused by the possible lack of financial stability or lower income.
2) Defaul Rate in Middle Age Groups (30-49):
Both the group of 30-39 and 40-49 have similar and relatively low default rates of about 12%. These groups may have more stable financial situations, higher incomes or maybe are more experienced at managing debt, leading to a lower default rate.
3) Increased Default Rate in Older Age Group (50+):
The default ratio for elderly people is in between the younger and middle age groups. Some consideration for why this could be the case may be the approaching retirement maybe causing a reduction of the income or an increase in medical expenses.

Bar Plots:
```{r}
# Bar plot for the distribution of customers by age group
ggplot(age_distribution, aes(x = age_group, y = total_customers, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Customers by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Number of Customers") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")

# Bar plot for default rates by age group
ggplot(age_distribution, aes(x = age_group, y = default_rate, fill = age_group)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Default Rates by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group",
       y = "Default Rate (%)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3")
```


QUESTION 4: Is there a significant difference in work experience between customers who default and those who don't?

```{r}
# Calculate the average work experience by default status
work_experience <- filtered_data %>%
  group_by(default) %>%
  summarise(average_work_experience = mean(employ, na.rm = TRUE))

print(work_experience)
```
Considerations: Considering that customer who defaulted have an average of 9.5 years of work experience while the ones that defaulted have more or less 4 years less, this indicates that non-defaulters tend to have signidicantly more work experience than defaulters.

T-Test for Statistical Significance:
```{r}
# Perform a t-test to check if the difference in work experience is statistically significant
t_test_resultq4 <- t.test(employ ~ default, data = filtered_data)
print(t_test_resultq4)
```
Interpretation: The t-statistic is quite large, and the p-value is extremely small (well below any common significance level like 0.05 or 0.01). This indicates that there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups’ average work experience.

Calculating Cohen’s d can provide additional context about the size of the effect. A larger Cohen’s d value would indicate a more substantial difference between the groups.

Cohen's d:
```{r}
# Calculate means
mean_non_default <- mean(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 0], na.rm = TRUE)
mean_default <- mean(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 1], na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate standard deviations
sd_non_default <- sd(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 0], na.rm = TRUE)
sd_default <- sd(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 1], na.rm = TRUE)

# Calculate sample sizes
n_non_default <- sum(!is.na(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 0]))
n_default <- sum(!is.na(filtered_data$employ[filtered_data$default == 1]))

# Pooled standard deviation
pooled_sd <- sqrt(((n_non_default - 1) * sd_non_default^2 + (n_default - 1) * sd_default^2) / (n_non_default + n_default - 2))

# Cohen's d
cohen_d <- (mean_non_default - mean_default) / pooled_sd

# Print Cohen's d
print(cohen_d)
```
Interpretation: With a Cohen’s d of 0.67, the difference in work experience between customers who default and those who do not is substantial. It falls between the “medium” and “large” effect size categories, suggesting that the difference is not only statistically significant but also of considerable practical significance.

Box Plot:
```{r}
ggplot(filtered_data, aes(x = factor(default), y = employ)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 35)) +
  labs(x = "Default Status", y = "Work Experience", title = "Work Experience by Default Status") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Non-Defaulter", "Defaulter")) +
  theme_minimal()
```


QUESTION 5: What is the average credit-to-debt ratio for different income brakets?

```{r}
# Create income brackets
data <- data %>%
  mutate(income_bracket = case_when(
    income < 30 ~ '< 30k',
    income >= 30 & income < 60 ~ '30k-59k',
    income >= 60 & income < 100 ~ '60k-100k',
    income >= 100 ~ '100k+',
    TRUE ~ NA_character_
  ))

# Calculate the average credit-to-debt ratio by income bracket
credit_to_debt_stats <- data %>%
  group_by(income_bracket) %>%
  summarise(
    average_credit_to_debt_ratio = mean(creddebt, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_credit_to_debt_ratio = median(creddebt, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd_credit_to_debt_ratio = sd(creddebt, na.rm = TRUE),
    min_credit_to_debt_ratio = min(creddebt, na.rm = TRUE),
    max_credit_to_debt_ratio = max(creddebt, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(credit_to_debt_stats)
```

Bar Plot:
```{r}
ggplot(credit_to_debt_stats, aes(x = income_bracket, y = average_credit_to_debt_ratio)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", alpha = 0.7) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = average_credit_to_debt_ratio - sd_credit_to_debt_ratio, ymax = average_credit_to_debt_ratio + sd_credit_to_debt_ratio), width = 0.2) +
  labs(x = "Income Bracket", y = "Average Credit-to-Debt Ratio", title = "Average Credit-to-Debt Ratio by Income Bracket") +
  theme_minimal()
```
This graph effectively illustrates the relationship between income and credit-to-debt ratios, showing that as income increases, the average credit-to-debt ratio tends to increase as well. The error bars provide insight into the variability within each income bracket, suggesting that higher-income individuals have a wider range of credit-to-debt ratios.

Given the fact that normality and homogeneity of variance are not expected in the model, it is appropriate to use the Kruskal-Wallis test to evaluate the significance of the results. The Kruskal-Wallis test is a non-parametric method for testing whether samples originate from the same distribution. It is used when the assumptions of ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) are violated, specifically when the data does not follow a normal distribution and/or when the variances across groups are not equal.

Kruskal-Wallis test:
```{r}
kruskal.test(creddebt ~ income_bracket, data = data)
```
The results from the Kruskal-Wallis test indicate that there is a statistically significant difference in the credit-to-debt ratios across the different income brackets ( p -value < 2.2e-16). This highly significant p-value suggests that the distributions of credit-to-debt ratios are not the same across the income brackets, implying that income level has a significant impact on credit-to-debt ratios.

Given the significant result of the Kruskal-Wallis test, it is necessary to proceed with post-hoc pairwise comparisons to identify which specific income brackets differ from each other. Post-hoc tests are required because the Kruskal-Wallis test itself does not tell us which groups are different; it only indicates that at least one group is different.

To perform post-hoc pairwise comparisons, Dunn’s test can be used, which is a non-parametric method suitable for multiple comparisons following a Kruskal-Wallis test.

Dunn's test:
```{r}
# Perform Dunn's test with Bonferroni correction
dunn_results <- dunnTest(creddebt ~ income_bracket, data = data, method = "bonferroni")

# View the results
print(dunn_results)
```
The Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed that there are significant differences in credit-to-debt ratios across income brackets. The subsequent Dunn’s test with Bonferroni correction revealed that all pairwise comparisons between income brackets are statistically significant. These findings indicate that income bracket plays a crucial role in determining credit-to-debt ratios, with higher income brackets generally exhibiting higher ratios. This information is critical for understanding financial behavior and risk across different income levels.

Considerations: From the results, there is a clear progressive increase in the average credit-to-debt ratio as the income bracket increases; this suggests tha higher income individuals tend to have higher credit usage relative to their debt levels compared to lower incoe individuals.
Individuals in the highest income bracket (100k+) have the highest average credit-to-debt ratio (4.58). This could indicate that higher-income individuals have more access to credit and might be using credit for investments or large purchases more frequently than lower-income groups. Those in the middle-income brackets (30k-59k and 60k-100k) show a moderate increase in their credit-to-debt ratios. This could suggest a balanced approach to credit usage and debt management. Individuals in the lowest income bracket (< 30k) have the lowest average credit-to-debt ratio (0.76). This could indicate limited access to credit or more cautious use of available credit, potentially due to financial constraints or stricter lending criteria.






Strategic Implications and Suggestions:

1. Credit Risk Assessment:

	•	Income: Consider income levels as a significant factor in credit risk assessment. Higher income is associated with lower default risk.
	•	Work Experience: Incorporate work experience into credit scoring models. Less experienced individuals might require stricter evaluation criteria.

2. Tailored Financial Products:

	•	Income-Based Products: Design financial products that account for varying income levels. For example, offer more flexible repayment terms for lower-income customers.
	•	Age-Based Products: Create tailored products for different age groups. Younger customers might benefit from lower initial interest rates, while older customers could use products that consider retirement and medical expenses.

3. Financial Education:

	•	For Lower-Income Groups: Implement financial education programs to improve financial literacy and management skills, reducing default risks.
	•	For Younger Age Groups: Develop targeted financial education for younger individuals to enhance their understanding of credit management.

4. Risk Mitigation Strategies:

	•	Higher Credit-to-Debt Ratios: While higher income groups show higher credit-to-debt ratios, it’s essential to monitor over-leverage risks. Implement regular reviews and provide guidance to manage credit usage effectively.
	•	Lower Income Groups: Even though lower-income groups have lower credit-to-debt ratios, consider potential financial stress during emergencies. Offer products with safety nets, such as emergency funds or payment deferrals.

Ultimate Conclusion:

The analysis reveals critical insights into the relationships between income, education, age, work experience, and financial behaviors. Higher income and more work experience are associated with lower default risks, while education level does not significantly impact debt-to-income ratios. Age plays a significant role, with younger and older age groups showing higher default rates. Credit-to-debt ratios increase with income, indicating better credit access and financial management among higher-income individuals.

By incorporating these insights into strategic planning, financial institutions can enhance their risk assessment processes, develop tailored financial products, and implement effective financial education programs. These measures will not only mitigate risks but also promote financial stability and responsible credit usage among customers.
